# Day 2

## Patterns and common packages

A review of tools written in Go:

- batch renaming files/directories (shenwei356/brename)
- inspect Linux namespaces and cgroups (mhausenblas/cinf)
- back up and restore Kubernetes clusters (http://reshifter.info/)
- automatic container resource consumption management in Kubernetes (openshift-demos/resorcerer)
- library for implementing RBAC (ory/ladon)

## Implementing your own tool

- Reimplementing one of the tools youâ€™ve developed in another language (bash scripts, Python, etc.)
- Writing a tool you will need in the near future from scratch
- Creating a tool from scratch, instructor-provided examples
