## Useful packages and patterns

A review of tools written in Go:

- batch renaming files/directories (shenwei356/brename)
- inspect Linux namespaces and cgroups (mhausenblas/cinf)
- back up and restore Kubernetes clusters (mhausenblas/reshifter)
- automatic container resource consumption management in Kubernetes (openshift-demos/resorcerer)
- library for implementing RBAC (ory/ladon)

## Implementing your own tool

- Reimplementing one of the tools youâ€™ve developed in another language (bash scripts, Python, etc.)
